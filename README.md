# Transparent Public Fund Allocation

This project implements a blockchain-based system for transparent and accountable public fund management. The platform enables citizens and oversight bodies to track the flow of public money from budget approval through procurement and expenditure to performance outcomes, enhancing accountability and reducing corruption in public spending.

## Core Components

1. **Budget Approval Contract**
    - Records authorized spending allocations by department and category
    - Maintains immutable history of budget amendments and approvals
    - Implements multi-signature requirements for budget authorization
    - Provides public visibility into planned expenditures

2. **Expenditure Tracking Contract**
    - Monitors actual spending against approved budgets in real-time
    - Flags variances and unauthorized expenditures automatically
    - Creates permanent audit trail of all financial transactions
    - Enables drill-down analysis of spending patterns

3. **Procurement Verification Contract**
    - Validates that purchases follow required bidding procedures
    - Records vendor selection processes and decision criteria
    - Ensures contract terms match approved parameters
    - Prevents payments to unapproved or blacklisted vendors

4. **Performance Measurement Contract**
    - Tracks outcomes and impact of funded projects
    - Links expenditures to measurable deliverables and milestones
    - Enables value-for-money analysis across departments
    - Provides data for evidence-based budgeting in future cycles
